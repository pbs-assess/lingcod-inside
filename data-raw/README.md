# data-raw/

This folder contains .R scripts that pull data from various sources and write the data as .rda files in the data/ folder. The data/ folder is ignored by git to reduce storage space on GitHub, and is stored separately.

The use of data-raw/ to contain .R scripts to pull and prepare data follows the convention decribed in [R packages 2e](https://r-pkgs.org/data.html#sec-data-data-raw).
